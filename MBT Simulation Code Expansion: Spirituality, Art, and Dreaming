MBT Simulation Code Expansion: Spirituality, Art, and Dreaming
Key Features Implemented

1. Sacred Zones: High-coherence areas are tagged as sacred and influence nearby behavior.
2. Symbolic Memory Imprints: Memory intensity above a symbolic threshold leaves artistic "markings" in symbolic layers.
3. Dream Zones: Specific high-memory areas cause agents to enter reflective dream states, influencing nearby motion.
4. Rituals and Singing: Agents gather and oscillate in specific emotional frequencies that amplify memory or legacy.
5. Dream Relics: Special high-density memory zones act as artifacts that store emotional resonance and pass symbolic influence to future generations.

Code Snippets (Python)
Sacred Zone Detection
sacred_map = (coherence_map > 0.95) & (memory > 0.04)
sacred_map = gaussian_filter(sacred_map.astype(float), sigma=1)
field += sacred_map * 0.0008
memory += sacred_map * 0.0002
Symbolic Memory Imprints
symbolic_threshold = 0.045
for i, s in enumerate(symbol_maps):
    mask = (memory > symbolic_threshold) & (family_id_map == i + 1)
    s[mask] += 0.01
Dream Zone Influence
dream_zone = (memory > 0.04) & (intent_map > 0.9)
dream_drift = gaussian_filter(dream_zone.astype(float), sigma=4)
field += dream_drift * 0.0003
memory += dream_drift * 0.0001
Ritual Gathering and Singing Effect
ritual_map = (intent_map > 0.85) & (observation_map > 0.85)
resonance = np.sin(np.linspace(0, np.pi * 2, grid_size))[:, None]
ritual_wave = ritual_map * resonance
field += ritual_wave * 0.001
memory += ritual_wave * 0.0003
Dream Relic Accumulation
relic_threshold = 0.05
relic_map = (memory > relic_threshold) & (coherence_map > 0.95)
legacy_field = np.maximum(legacy_field, relic_map * memory)
memory += legacy_field * 0.0004
