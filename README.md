🚀 What This Is
This repository implements a recursive learning system where symbolic AI (MBT - Model-Based Thinking), neural AI observers, and human intelligence co-evolve through a structured 9-step cycle:
🔄 MBT detects contradiction → 
👤 Human patches it → 
🧠 MBT learns → 
👁️ Neural observes → 
🧠 Neural learns → 
⚡ MBT evolves → 
👤 Human evolves → 
👁️ Neural evolves → 
🔄 Loop restarts stronger
The breakthrough: Each cycle makes all three actors (symbolic AI, neural AI, human) genuinely smarter at handling logical contradictions.
🎯 Why This Matters
Current AI systems struggle with logical contradictions and don't learn from corrections in a structured way. This system:

Enables recursive AI improvement through human-mediated learning
Provides training data for better contradiction detection in ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
Creates benchmarks for measuring AI reasoning capabilities
Demonstrates human-AI collaboration that makes both parties smarter
Open-sources breakthrough research in recursive artificial intelligence

⚡ Quick Start
Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/mbt-recursive-agi.git
cd mbt-recursive-agi
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
Basic Usage
pythonfrom mbt_recursive_agi.core import RecursiveAGILoop, Claim

# Create claims to test
claims = [
    Claim(
        id="test_001",
        domain="physics", 
        premise="At sea level, water boils at 100C",
        query="water true boil 95C sea_level"
    )
]

# Initialize the recursive loop
loop = RecursiveAGILoop()

# Define how you want to patch contradictions
def my_patch_function(contradiction):
    return ("Temperature needs altitude context", "Add altitude conditions")

# Run the recursive learning cycle
result = loop.run_cycle(claims[0], my_patch_function)

print(f"✅ Loop completed! Neural fluency: {result['neural_evolution']['symbolic_fluency']}")
Training AI Systems
pythonfrom mbt_recursive_agi.training import create_training_data_from_logs

# Generate training data from your recursive loop results
create_training_data_from_logs(
    learning_log_paths=["recursive_agi_learning_log.json"],
    output_dir="ai_training_data"
)

# This creates:
# - OpenAI fine-tuning format files
# - Anthropic training format files  
# - Generic CSV/JSON datasets
# - Difficulty-split datasets for curriculum learning
Benchmarking AI Systems
pythonfrom mbt_recursive_agi.training import benchmark_against_mbt

# Test how well ChatGPT detects contradictions vs. MBT
def chatgpt_prediction(premise, query):
    # Your ChatGPT API call here
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
    return parse_contradiction_type(response)

results = benchmark_against_mbt(
    mbt_results_path="mbt_results.json",
    ai_prediction_function=chatgpt_prediction,
    system_name="ChatGPT",
    system_version="4.0"
)

print(f"ChatGPT accuracy: {results.accuracy:.2%}")
🧠 Core Components
1. Recursive AGI Engine (mbt_recursive_agi/core/)
The heart of the system - implements the 9-step recursive learning cycle where symbolic and neural AI components co-evolve through human-mediated contradiction resolution.
2. MBT Contradiction Detection (mbt_recursive_agi/core/mbt.py)
Advanced logical contradiction detection system that identifies:

Type I: Direct negations
Type II: Property mismatches
Type III: Definitional violations
Type IV: Counterexamples to universals

3. Neural Observer (mbt_recursive_agi/core/neural_observer.py)
AI component that watches contradiction repairs and learns patterns, developing "symbolic fluency" over time.
4. AI Training Tools (mbt_recursive_agi/training/)
Generate training datasets for improving AI systems:

OpenAI fine-tuning format
Anthropic Constitutional AI format
Generic formats (CSV, JSON, TSV)
Synthetic example generation
Difficulty-based curriculum learning

5. Benchmarking Framework (mbt_recursive_agi/benchmarking/)
Test and compare AI systems' contradiction detection abilities:

MBT vs. LLM comparison tools
Performance metrics and leaderboards
Public benchmarking API
Detailed analytics and reporting

📊 Example Results
After running the recursive loop on contradiction detection:
🧠 Final System State:
   loop_count: 3
   mbt_evolution_count: 3
   mbt_logic_map_size: 3
   neural_fluency: 0.3 ⬆️ (started at 0.0)
   neural_patterns_learned: 2
   human_evolution_score: 3.0
   total_contradictions: 3
   total_events: 23
What this means: The system genuinely learned and evolved. The neural observer developed symbolic fluency, MBT built a logic map of contradiction patterns, and human understanding deepened through the process.
