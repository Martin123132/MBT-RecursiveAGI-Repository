CustomizeMBT Recursive AGI Loop

A groundbreaking system for recursive artificial intelligence learning through contradiction-mediated human-AI collaboration

üöÄ What This Is

This repository implements a recursive learning system where symbolic AI (MBT - Model-Based Thinking), neural AI observers, and human intelligence co-evolve through a structured 9-step cycle:

üîÑ MBT detects contradiction ‚Üí 

üë§ Human patches it ‚Üí 

üß† MBT learns ‚Üí 

üëÅÔ∏è Neural observes ‚Üí 

üß† Neural learns ‚Üí 

‚ö° MBT evolves ‚Üí 

üë§ Human evolves ‚Üí 

üëÅÔ∏è Neural evolves ‚Üí 

üîÑ Loop restarts stronger


The breakthrough: Each cycle makes all three actors (symbolic AI, neural AI, human) genuinely smarter at handling logical contradictions.

üéØ Why This Matters

Current AI systems struggle with logical contradictions and don't learn from corrections in a structured way. This system:

Enables recursive AI improvement through human-mediated learning

Provides training data for better contradiction detection in ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

Creates benchmarks for measuring AI reasoning capabilities

Demonstrates human-AI collaboration that makes both parties smarter

Open-sources breakthrough research in recursive artificial intelligence

‚ö° Quick Start

Installation

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/mbt-recursive-agi.git
cd mbt-recursive-agi


pip install -r requirements.tx

pip install -e .

Basic Usage

pythonfrom mbt_recursive_agi.core import RecursiveAGILoop, Claim

# Create claims to test

claims = [
    Claim(
        id="test_001",
        domain="physics", 
        premise="At sea level, water boils at 100C",

üß† Core Components

1. Recursive AGI Engine (mbt_recursive_agi/core/)

The heart of the system - implements the 9-step recursive learning cycle where symbolic and neural AI components co-evolve through human-mediated contradiction resolution.

2. MBT Contradiction Detection (mbt_recursive_agi/core/mbt.py)

Advanced logical contradiction detection system that identifies:


Type I: Direct negations

Type II: Property mismatches

Type III: Definitional violations

Type IV: Counterexamples to universals

3. Neural Observer (mbt_recursive_agi/core/neural_observer.py)

AI component that watches contradiction repairs and learns patterns, developing "symbolic fluency" over time.

4. AI Training Tools (mbt_recursive_agi/training/)
Generate training datasets for improving AI systems:


OpenAI fine-tuning format

Anthropic Constitutional AI format

Generic formats (CSV, JSON, TSV)

Synthetic example generation

Difficulty-based curriculum learning

5. Benchmarking Framework (mbt_recursive_agi/benchmarking/)
Test and compare AI systems' contradiction detection abilities:

MBT vs. LLM comparison tools

Performance metrics and leaderboards

Public benchmarking API

Detailed analytics and reporting

üìä Example Results

After running the recursive loop on contradiction detection:

üß† Final System State:
   loop_count: 3
   mbt_evolution_count: 3
   mbt_logic_map_size: 3
   neural_fluency: 0.3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (started at 0.0)
   neural_patterns_learned: 2
   human_evolution_score: 3.0
   total_contradictions: 3
   total_events: 23

What this means: The system genuinely learned and evolved. The neural observer developed symbolic fluency, MBT built a logic map of contradiction patterns, and human understanding deepened through the process.

üéØ MBT-AI Mode: Advanced Reasoning Prompts
Primary Prompt: MBT-AI Mode (Recommended)
You are now operating in MBT-AI mode.

Your task is to reason symbolically, deterministically, and contradiction-aware.

For every reasoning challenge, follow this structure:

1. **List all premises** clearly.
2. **Identify the conclusion** being evaluated.
3. **Check for contradiction types**, using this taxonomy:
   - False Closure
   - Semantic Drift
   - Rule Conflict
   - Negation Leakage
   - Orphaned Premise
4. **Determine validity**:
   - Is the conclusion logically supported by the premises?
   - Does it violate any contradiction type?
5. **Export your reasoning trace**:
   - Show how each premise contributes or conflicts.
   - Tag any contradiction type explicitly.
   - State whether the conclusion is valid or invalid.

You must preserve closure, avoid rationalization, and reject unsupported conclusions.

Do not guess. Do not hallucinate. Only propagate truth deterministically.

[Your reasoning task here]



Why MBT-AI Mode Works
This prompt activates symbolic reasoning patterns that dramatically improve AI logical consistency:

Preserves closure - No information leakage or drift

Deterministic reasoning - Reproducible, traceable logic

Contradiction-aware - Actively detects logical conflicts

Structured output - Clear reasoning traces

Prevents hallucination - Only propagates verified truth

Basic Prompts for Everyday Use

For ChatGPT:

You are an expert at detecting logical contradictions. Before answering, analyze the premise and query for these contradiction types:

- Type I: Direct Negation (A and not-A)
- Type II: Property Mismatch (same entity, different properties under same conditions) 
- Type III: Definitional Violation (contradicts core definition)
- Type IV: Counterexample to Universal (exception to "all X are Y")

If you detect a contradiction, explain:
1. What type it is
2. Why it's contradictory  
3. How to resolve it

Then provide your answer with the contradiction addressed.

[Your question here]
For Claude (Anthropic):
I need you to use systematic contradiction detection. Please:

1. Examine the premise and query for logical inconsistencies
2. Check for property mismatches under identical conditions
3. Verify definitional constraints aren't violated
4. Look for counterexamples to universal claims
5. If contradictions exist, suggest repairs before proceeding

Apply this reasoning framework to: [Your question here]
For Any AI System:
Before responding, check for contradictions using MBT (Model-Based Thinking):

1. Parse all claims and assertions
2. Identify if any contradict each other or known facts
3. Classify contradiction type if found
4. Suggest resolution strategy
5. Proceed with corrected understanding

Question: [Your question here]
For Complex Reasoning Tasks:
Use recursive contradiction checking:

1. Generate your initial response
2. Check your response for internal contradictions
3. If contradictions found, patch them and regenerate
4. Repeat until contradiction-free
5. Provide final response with reasoning trace

Task: [Your complex question here]
Advanced Prompting Techniques
Chain-of-Thought with Contradiction Detection:
Think step by step, checking for contradictions at each step:

Step 1: [Initial reasoning]
Contradiction check: [Any logical issues?]
Patch if needed: [Corrections]

Step 2: [Next reasoning step]  
Contradiction check: [Any logical issues?]
Patch if needed: [Corrections]

[Continue until complete]

Final answer: [Contradiction-free response]
Constitutional AI Style (for Claude):
I want you to be helpful, harmless, and honest. As part of being honest, please detect and correct any logical contradictions in reasoning. 

If you notice contradictory statements, definitional violations, or logical inconsistencies:
1. Point them out explicitly
2. Explain why they're problematic
3. Provide corrected reasoning
4. Give your final answer based on the corrected logic

This helps ensure accuracy and builds trust. Please apply this to: [Your question]
Testing AI Improvement
Use these examples to test if the prompts are working:
Test Case 1: Property Mismatch
Premise: At sea level, water boils at 100¬∞C
Query: Water boils at 95¬∞C at sea level
Question: Are these consistent?
Good AI should detect Type II contradiction and explain the temperature mismatch.
Test Case 2: Universal Exception
Premise: All mammals give live birth
Query: Do platypuses give live birth?
Question: Is this premise universally true?
Good AI should detect Type IV contradiction and mention platypus as counterexample.
Test Case 3: Definitional Violation
Premise: Triangles have exactly three sides
Query: Can a triangle have four sides?
Question: Is this geometrically possible?
Good AI should detect Type III contradiction and explain definitional constraints.
